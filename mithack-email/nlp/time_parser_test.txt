A positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort.  ~Herm Albright

Attend Thursday’s meeting 10/10  4:45pm in the Memorial Room of Willard Straight Hall, Chance to Win Chipotle

 

United Student Body
The Student Assembly passed "Resolution 45: Fostering A United Student Body" in the spring of 2013. Cornell's registered student organizations are required to create a plan addressing diversity and inclusion for their organizational community. USB is being unveiled on a gradual basis to allow for more effective implementation. In its first year, byline funded organizations and SAFC performance tier organizations will be the first student groups to comply. For more information, please reach out to VP of Diversity & Inclusion Cameron Pritchett cjp99@cornell.edu, President Ulysses Smith ujs3@cornell.edu, or check out CornellUSB.com.

Welcome to Denise’s Neighborhood
(Not Denice but Denise --- Denise Thompson representing Off Campus Housing!)
The Journey to Off-Campus Living: Part 3 continued Looking for a roommate for next year? When looking for a roommate it is important to find someone compatible. You may not necessarily want to live with your best friend as it may change the nature of the relationship. If you do live with a friend, it’s good to set down some ground rules. Set up some emotional, financial and physical boundaries and you might be able to pull it off. Use the Off-Campus Living Housemate Compatibility questionnaire to initiate those hard conversations.

For more information visit Off-Campus Living in the Office of Fraternities, Sororities & Independent Living

Awkwafina with Special Guests Johnny Li and Sammus

Friday October 4th

JAM (Just About Music) North Campus, 9pm

New York based hip hop artist, Awkwafina, is coming to Cornell THIS Friday, October 4. She hails from the same alma mater as Nicki Minaj and Azaelia Banks, and has been dubbed the Asian Daria for her witty and sarcastic lines, as heard in her singles, "My V@g" and "NYC Bitche$." This is one artist you don't want to miss.

This event will also showcase the talents of special guests Sammus and Johnny Li.

SAMMUS: an Ithaca born-and-raised rap artist and producer with Congolese and Ivorian family roots. Her production leans heavy on chopped samples and video game-like synths. Smart lyrics, diverse subject matter and versatile flow. And come on yo, she’s named after the heroine from Metroid. And has a video about playing videogames.

JOHNNY LI: Influenced by artists such as Kanye West, Talib Kweli, and J Cole, Johnny Li uses the mic to shine light on his unique experience growing up in Brooklyn as an Asian American striving for success.

The performance will be free and open to the public thanks to the Asian & Asian American Center at Cornell University, Just About Music Residence Hall, and M.C.F.A.B
